Extra Credit Attempt for Norah Swatland - CSE 30151

NFA to DFA Converter Python Script 

1. What was the extra work?

I made a python script that takes in a csv file that describes an NFA, 
creates an equivalent DFA. It then displays the DFA's attribute to 
stdin. 

2. Why did you choose it? How did this help improve your understanding? 

I chose to create an NFA to DFA converter because I initially really 
struggled with converting NFA's to DFA's by hand (Missed on Exam 1, 
Homework 02, Problem ...). I thought if I had to implement it in python
I would understand the process thoroughly. After completing the project, 
I feel a lot better about these conversions. 

3. What files are what 

1) NFA_to_DFA.py is the main script that accepts a csv file that 
describes an NFA and outputs an equivalent DFA. 

2) output.txt is an example output

3) How to run it: python3 NFA_to_DFA.py NFA_example.csv
