Extra Credit 2 - CSE 30151 Norah Swatland 

This python script takes in a csv file that describes a
Context Free Grammar (CFG) and outputs an equivalent Push
Down Automata. 

1. What was the extra work? 

I coded a python script that takes in a CSV file describing
a Context Free Grammar (CFG) and creates and displays the 
equivalent Push Down Automata (PDA).

2. Why did you choose it? How did it help improve your understanding? 

I chose converting a CFG to a PDA because I was having trouble grasping
how to convert CFGs into PDAs. I also struggled with creating and 
understanding PDAs in general so I thought creating one from a CFG would
give me some practice understanding PDAs. I now understand PDAs more 
and am feeling better about a PDA question on the final. 

3. What files are what? 

1) CFG_to_PDA.py is the python script that takes in the csv file. 

2) CFG_example.txt is an example input file that describes a CFG.

4. How to run 

python3 CFG_to_PDA.py CFG_example.txt
